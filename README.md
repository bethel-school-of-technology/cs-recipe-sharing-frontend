# Welcome!
We're so glad you are here to check out our awesome code! This project is the brain child of 4 developers finishing up their final project at Bethel School of Technology.

## What to Expect
This project was created as a website to share recipes, a type of "social media" site for recipes. Inside the webiste you can create an account, login/logout, share a recipe, view other people's recipes, and favorite the recipes you want to come back to.

This project has two components: the front end and the back end. Both need to be up and running in order to fully see the website.


## Installing The Front End 
The front end was built using ReactJS. To install it, simply follow these steps:
1. Download this repository from GitHub
2. Open the downloaded folder with your terminal or VS code terminal
3. Ensure yarn is installed on your computer: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable
4. Run the command in your terminal: `yarn install`
5. When yarn is done initializing the project, you can then run the command: `yarn start`
6. This project will not fully run without also installing the back end: https://github.com/bethel-school-of-technology/cs-recipe-sharing-backend

## Thanks!
